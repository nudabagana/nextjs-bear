**Characteristics**

The flames of a dragon grow hotter and fiercer as the dragon ages. The flames of a hatchling can set straw aflame, whereas the flames of much older dragons are able to melt steel and stone. A dragon's scales, which thicken with age, protects the dragon from fire, although it is not entirely impervious to flame.

**History**

The Valyrian Freehold used dragonflame to make Valyrian steel. It was also employed in construction to melt and fuse stone to form dragonstone, as in the cases of the dragonroads and the Black Wall of Volantis.

During Aegon's Conquest, Aegon I Targaryen used Balerion's dragonflame against Harrenhal and at the Field of Fire. Afterward, the flames of Balerion were used to forge the Iron Throne. Aegon and his sister-wife Visenya used the flames of their dragons Balerion and Vhagar to burn every Dornish stronghold at least once, with the exception of Sunspear and its shadow city.

King Maegor I Targaryen and his mother, Dowager Queen Visenya, used their dragons Balerion and Vhagar to burn several holdfasts in the Reach and westerlands in 43 AC.

During the Dance of the Dragons, King Aegon II Targaryen is severely injured during the battle at Rook's Rest when dragonflame melts his armor into the flesh of his left arm. While attempting to claim the dragon Sheepstealer during the Red Sowing, Alyn Velaryon was injured by burns that covered his back and legs.

Silverwing, Sheepstealer, Seasmoke, and Vermithor descended upon the fleet of the Triarchy in the early days of 130 AC, and burned the ships by spitting balls of fire, "blue and orange, red and gold". Prince Aemond Targaryen brought Vhagar to the riverlands, where he burned numerous villages and castles.

Aegon II Targaryen and Sunfyre fought Lady Baela Targaryen and her dragon Moondancer on Dragonstone in 130 AC. During the battle, Moondancer was blinded by Sunfyre's flames, ans shortly after succumbed to wounds received in battle. Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen was later executed by her brother, Aegon II, by being engulfed in Sunfyre's flames.

The Targaryens practise the custom of cremating their deceased family members. The funeral pyre of Aegon I Targaryen was lit by the dragon Vhagar, and the funeral pyre of Aenys I Targaryen by the dragons Quicksilver, Vermithor and Silverwing.

Wildfire is said to be a close cousin of dragonflame.
